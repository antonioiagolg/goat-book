# Takeaways

* Test is a discipline, it is a skill. You have to train every day the testing movements (make it work, make it right and make it fast) by using the red, green and refactor.

* Functional tests (or acceptance tests or end-to-end tests) give us the objective, what we want to achieve. This is the test the user do, but we can do it in a programmatic way.

* Unit tests give us the fast feedback, what are the behaviors we want to have in our feature (the functional test).

* Don't test implementation, but test behaviors (check what we should have, not how we should have)
